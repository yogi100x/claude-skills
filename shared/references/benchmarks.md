## How to Use This Guide

1. **Assess your stage**: Identify your business stage (Pre-seed → Growth) and compare key metrics
2. **Identify gaps**: Benchmark your metrics against the "Best-in-Class" or "Average" columns
3. **Prioritize levers**: Focus on the metrics with largest impact (CAC payback, churn, NDR)
4. **Segment context**: B2B metrics differ sharply from B2C; SMB vs Enterprise are separate
5. **Understand causation**: Low conversion rates may stem from traffic quality, not landing page design
6. **Iterate rigorously**: Test one variable at a time; expect 5-10% lift per optimization

**Last Updated:** February 2025
**Sources:** SaaS benchmarks aggregated from Seed-Series B venture data, public company S-1s, industry reports (ProfitWell, Semrush, Contently, HubSpot), and academic LLM evaluations.
