# Industry Profiles Reference

A comprehensive guide to business model characteristics, metrics, sales motions, and common pitfalls across 8 primary industry categories.

---

## 1. B2B SaaS (Business-to-Business Software-as-a-Service)

### Quick Reference

| Metric | Typical Range | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Gross Margin** | 70-85% | High margin due to software scaling |
| **Sales Cycle** | 3-9 months | Longer for enterprise, shorter for SMB |
| **Primary Metric** | MRR / ARR | Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue |
| **Key Risk** | Churn & Expansion Rate | Retention and upsell are critical |

### Typical Metrics Tracked
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Cost to acquire one customer
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Total profit per customer over lifetime
- **CAC Payback Period**: Months to recover CAC from gross profit
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: Predictable monthly revenue
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**: Annualized MRR
- **Churn Rate**: % customers lost per month (gross & net)
- **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**: Impact of expansion, churn, downgrade
- **Magic Number**: (Quarter MRR Growth / Prior Quarter S&M Spend)
- **Rule of 40**: Growth rate + Profit margin ≥ 40%
- **Customer Health Score**: Predictive engagement metric

### Sales Motion
1. **Freemium** (optional) → Free trial or freemium tier to build users
2. **Product-Led Growth (PLG)** → Self-serve signup, expansion from usage
3. **Sales-Assisted** (SMB) → Sales reps for mid-market, self-serve for low-touch
4. **Enterprise Sales** (Larger deals) → Long sales cycles, multiple stakeholders, RFP process
5. **Land & Expand** → Start small, grow account value over time

### Pricing Patterns
- **Per-User/Seat**: $50-500+ per user per month
- **Per-Feature Tier**: Starter/Pro/Enterprise with graduated features
- **Usage-Based**: Charge per API call, data processed, or resource consumed
- **Hybrid**: Base fee + usage overage (common in APIs)
- **Annual Discount**: 15-25% discount for annual prepayment (improves cash flow)

### Marketing Priorities by Stage

| Stage | Focus | Channels |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Awareness** | Thought leadership, educational content | Blog, webinars, LinkedIn |
| **Consideration** | Case studies, comparisons, product demos | Website, G2, captive videos |
| **Decision** | ROI calculators, customer testimonials, free trials | Sales calls, case studies, webinars |
| **Retention** | Onboarding content, best practices, communities | Email, in-app guides, Slack groups |

### Key Channels
- **Inbound**: SEO (long tail keywords), content marketing, webinars
- **Outbound**: LinkedIn sales navigator, email campaigns, cold calling (SDR teams)
- **Partnerships**: Channel partners, resellers, integrations (Zapier, API marketplaces)
- **Community**: User groups, open-source sponsorship, developer advocacy
- **Direct Sales**: Enterprise sales reps, account executives (AE), sales development reps (SDR)

### Legal Considerations
- **Terms of Service**: Enterprise amendments are common; prepare SOW templates
- **Data Processing Agreements (DPA)**: Required for GDPR compliance
- **SLA Terms**: Define uptime guarantees (typically 99.5-99.9%)
- **IP Ownership**: Clarify data ownership, confidentiality, and usage rights
- **Payment Terms**: Net 30/60/90 standard; enforce auto-renewal terms

### Finance Patterns
- **Subscription Model**: Recurring revenue creates predictable cash flow
- **Deferred Revenue**: Invoice upfront, recognize monthly (balance sheet liability)
- **Cash Conversion Cycle**: Improved over 24 months as renewal revenue compounds
- **Unit Economics**: Target LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 or higher
- **Bookings vs Revenue**: Bookings = signed contracts; Revenue = recognized monthly

### Common Mistakes
1. **Ignoring churn**: Focusing on new customer acquisition while losing existing customers
2. **Misaligned product-market fit**: Solving a problem no one will pay for
3. **Burning cash too fast**: Scaling sales before unit economics prove viable
4. **Poor onboarding**: High activation friction leads to early churn
5. **Feature creep over focus**: Building too many features instead of depth in core use case
6. **Not measuring CAC payback**: Blind scaling without knowing if it's profitable

## 2. Two-Sided Marketplace

### Quick Reference

| Metric | Typical Range | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Gross Margin** | 20-50% | Lower due to seller payouts, takes competitive pressure |
| **Sales Cycle** | Fast (both sides) | Supply on weeks, demand on weeks to months |
| **Primary Metric** | GMV / GTV | Gross Merchandise/Transaction Value |
| **Key Risk** | Liquidity & Network Effects | Both sides must grow together; winner-take-most dynamic |

### Typical Metrics Tracked
- **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)**: Total dollar volume of transactions
- **Take Rate**: % commission or transaction fee collected
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: Total active participants (supply + demand)
- **Supply/Demand Ratio**: Number of sellers vs buyers (balance critical)
- **Conversion Rate**: % of demand side that transacts
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Typical transaction size
- **Repeat Purchase Rate**: Frequency of repeat transactions
- **Seller Onboarding Rate**: Speed and scale of supply growth
- **Buyer Acquisition Cost (BAC)**: Cost to acquire a buyer
- **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)**: Time sellers spend with unsold inventory

### Sales Motion
1. **Cold Start Problem** → Bootstrap supply and demand simultaneously (chicken-and-egg)
2. **Supply-First**: Recruit high-volume sellers (restaurants, stores) to attract demand
3. **Demand-First**: Drive buyers through marketing, incentivize supply to follow
4. **Hybrid**: Vertical focus in one city/category; dominate locally before expanding
5. **Subsidize**: Offer discounts or guarantees to bootstrap liquidity (burn strategy)

### Pricing Patterns
- **Commission-Based**: 10-30% take rate on transaction value (Uber, DoorDash, Airbnb)
- **Freemium Supply, Premium Demand**: Free for sellers, charge buyers or advertisers
- **Subscription**: Seller premium tier for higher visibility; buyer subscription for benefits
- **Advertising**: Sellers pay for top placement, featured listings, or sponsored search
- **Hybrid**: Base commission + advertising + subscription (most mature marketplaces)

### Marketing Priorities by Stage

| Stage | Focus | Channels |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Bootstrap** | Unit economics proof in one neighborhood/vertical | On-ground marketing, local partnerships |
| **Supply Growth** | Seller recruitment, merchant support, incentives | Direct sales, partner networks, seller events |
| **Demand Growth** | Buyer awareness, acquisition, retention | Paid digital (ROAS-positive campaigns), referrals |
| **Scale** | Network effects, retention, monetization | Brand building, word-of-mouth, expansion to new verticals |

### Key Channels
- **Organic Virality**: Referral loops (Airbnb), invite mechanics (Uber, Lyft)
- **Paid Digital**: Facebook, Instagram, Google Ads with LTV-positive ROAS
- **Direct Sales (Supply)**: Sales teams recruiting sellers, partnership teams with large merchant chains
- **Community**: Local events, seller education, buyer brand love
- **PR/Viral**: Network effects drive word-of-mouth (most scalable channel)

### Legal Considerations
- **Contractor vs Employee**: Critical distinction (Uber/Lyft class-action lawsuits)
- **Payment Processing**: PCI compliance, fraud prevention, seller payouts (ACH/wire)
- **Liability & Insurance**: Who's liable for accidents, disputes, fraud, quality?
- **Terms of Service**: Both supply and demand sides need separate T&Cs
- **Tax Reporting**: 1099 reporting for sellers/independent contractors; sales tax collection

### Finance Patterns
- **Cash Flow Negative Early**: Subsidized supply/demand, churn on both sides
- **Take Rate Pressure**: Competition drives take rates down; must scale volume
- **Seller Payout Cycle**: Daily/weekly payouts to sellers required for liquidity; working capital strain
- **Marketplace Reserve**: Hold 5-15% of transactions in reserve for chargebacks/disputes
- **Path to Profitability**: Must reach critical mass; incremental margin improves with scale

### Common Mistakes
1. **Ignoring the hard side**: Focusing only on one side of the marketplace (e.g., buyers only)
2. **Trying to scale nationally before dominating locally**: Spreads resources thin; network effects weak
3. **Too-high commission**: Prices out supply or demand; competitors emerge
4. **Poor quality control**: Bad sellers/buyers erode trust; marketplace becomes toxic
5. **No fraud/payment risk management**: Chargebacks, scams, and disputes destroy margins
6. **Treating sides equally**: Supply and demand are NOT equally important; prioritize the constrained side

## 3. Developer Tools / API

### Quick Reference

| Metric | Typical Range | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Gross Margin** | 75-90% | Highest margin; pure software, minimal COGS |
| **Sales Cycle** | Fast (individuals), Medium (teams) | Developers self-serve; decisions made by engineering teams |
| **Primary Metric** | API Calls / Usage | Revenue tied to consumption, not contracts |
| **Key Risk** | Low switching costs | Easy to fork, replace, or build in-house |

### Typical Metrics Tracked
- **API Calls / Requests**: Daily, monthly, and annual API consumption
- **Monthly Active Developers (MAD)**: Unique developers using the API
- **Developer Activation Rate**: % of signups that make first API call
- **Free-to-Paid Conversion**: % of free users upgrading to paid
- **Developer Retention**: % of developers still using API month-over-month
- **Net Dollar Retention**: Revenue per developer growing or shrinking over time
- **Cost per Request**: Infrastructure cost to serve one API call
- **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: Revenue per paying developer
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often developers call the API (proxy for engagement)
- **Documentation Quality Score**: Affect on activation and retention

### Sales Motion
1. **Free Tier / Freemium**: Generous free tier (10k-100k calls/month) to drive adoption
2. **Self-Serve Signup**: Developer signup → API key generation → Direct integration
3. **Land & Expand**: Start with one team, grow to entire company
4. **Enterprise Sales**: Sales team for 6-7 figure deals with upfront usage guarantees
5. **Community**: Open-source SDKs, tutorials, community contributions

### Pricing Patterns
- **Usage-Based**: $0.0001 - $0.01 per API call (most common for APIs)
- **Tiered**: Free (0-10k calls), Starter ($29), Pro ($99), Enterprise (custom)
- **Per-Feature**: Pay for specific features or modules (Auth module, Database module, etc.)
- **Hybrid**: Base fee ($20) + usage overage ($0.001 per call over limits)
- **Commit-Based**: Annual commitment (e.g., $10k/year for 100M calls) with discount vs pay-as-you-go

### Marketing Priorities by Stage

| Stage | Focus | Channels |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Developer Awareness** | SEO, tutorials, demo projects | Technical blog, Stack Overflow, GitHub, Dev.to |
| **Integration** | Docs quality, SDKs, code examples | API docs, GitHub repositories, YouTube tutorials |
| **Expansion** | Feature releases, case studies, community | Email, API changelog, Slack communities |
| **Enterprise** | Reliability, support SLAs, compliance | Sales calls, security audits, dedicated support |

### Key Channels
- **Organic (SEO)**: "How to [use case]", "[API] tutorial", "Best [category] API"
- **Community**: GitHub stars, open-source contributions, dev communities (Discord, Slack)
- **Content**: Technical blogs, case studies, video tutorials, interactive demos
- **Partnerships**: Language SDKs, framework integrations (Rails, Next.js, FastAPI)

- **Direct Sales**: Sales team for enterprise customers only

### Legal Considerations
- **API Terms of Service**: Rate limits, acceptable use, liability caps
- **Data Processing**: Who owns data? Encryption in transit/rest? GDPR compliance?
- **SLA & Uptime**: Define service level obligations (99.9%, 99.99%)
- **Abuse & DDoS**: Rights to block malicious actors; communicate policy clearly
- **Payment Processing**: Automatic billing for overage; clear notification before charges

### Finance Patterns
- **Usage-Based Revenue**: Unpredictable month-to-month but no churn
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Highly variable with customer growth; margin compression risk
- **Account Concentration Risk**: Few customers can represent large % of revenue
- **Working Capital**: Billing lag between usage and payment; cash flow timing issues
- **Unit Economics**: Target 5:1 LTV:CAC or higher (lower customer acquisition cost, high lifetime value)

### Common Mistakes
1. **Over-engineering before product-market fit**: Building too much before developers want to use it
2. **Poor documentation**: Developers won't use an API they can't understand; docs = product
3. **Unreliable infrastructure**: One major outage kills trust; SLA commitments are critical
4. **Ignoring free users**: Free tier users are often future enterprise customers; invest in experience
5. **No product-led growth motion**: Requiring sales calls to get started hurts adoption
6. **Pricing opacity**: Hidden costs or surprise bills erode trust; be transparent

| **Sales Cycle** | Instant | Impulse to considered (days, not months) |
| **Primary Metric** | Revenue / Repeat Purchase Rate | DTC brands live by loyalty and repeat customers |

- **Shipping / Fulfillment**: International shipping, duties, local regulations
- **Product Liability**: Insurance for defective products; product safety compliance
- **Tax Compliance**: Sales tax by state/region; VAT for international orders

### Finance Patterns
- **Cash Flow Negative**: Upfront ad spend before customer lifetime value realization

2. **B2B Partnerships**: Integration with existing financial institutions
3. **API / White-Label**: Embedding fintech in other platforms
4. **Mobile-First**: Downloading app from App Store; viral/referral loops
5. **Content / Education**: Personal finance education drives engagement and trust
6. **Account-Based (B2B)**: Sales team for enterprise fintech partnerships

### Pricing Patterns
- **Transaction Fees**: Per-trade, per-transfer, per-transaction (stock trading, payments)
- **Subscription / Membership**: Monthly ($9.99 - $99/month) for premium features
- **Spread / Markup**: Interest rate differential (lending); FX spread (payments)
- **Flat Fee**: Annual or monthly flat fee for wealth management or advisory
- **Tiered AUM Fee**: % of assets under management (0.5%-2% typical)
- **Freemium**: Free basic features, paid premium features

### Marketing Priorities by Stage

| Stage | Focus | Channels |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Awareness** | Trust, credibility, educational content | Content marketing, financial blogs, podcasts |
| **Consideration** | Feature comparison, security/safety, reviews | Website, G2, YouTube, financial blogs, Reddit |
| **Acquisition** | Ease of signup, app downloads, referrals | App Store, paid ads, referral incentives |
| **Retention** | Financial outcomes, community, education | Email, in-app education, customer success |

### Key Channels
- **App Store Optimization**: Critical for consumer fintech
- **Content Marketing**: Personal finance blogs, YouTube (builds trust)
- **Paid Acquisition**: Facebook, Google Ads for app installs
- **Referral Programs**: Customer incentive programs (low CAC, high quality)
- **Partnerships**: Integration with other fintech, banks, brokerages
- **Direct Sales (B2B)**: Sales team for institutional partnerships

### Legal Considerations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Banking license, money transmitter license, state registration
- **AML / KYC**: Anti-money laundering; know-your-customer identity verification
- **Data Security**: PCI-DSS (payment card data), encryption, audit logs
- **Fraud Prevention**: Monitoring, blocking, customer disputes
- **Disclosures**: Interest rates, fees, risks clearly disclosed (Reg E, Truth in Lending)
- **Cybersecurity**: Breach notification, cyber liability insurance

### Finance Patterns
- **Float**: If holding customer deposits, interest earned on float (revenue source)
- **Capital Requirements**: Regulatory minimum capital reserves; impacts growth
- **Chargeback Reserve**: Hold % of transactions in reserve for disputes
- **NRR vs Churn**: Customer growth drives AUM; churn risks platform viability
- **Fraud Risk**: Chargebacks and fraud losses directly impact margins
- **Compliance Costs**: Audits, lawyers, consultants; scale improves unit economics

### Common Mistakes
1. **Ignoring fraud/compliance**: Security incident = business closure or massive fines
2. **Poor customer experience around money**: Confusing UX erodes trust; bugs = customer loss
3. **Weak KYC/AML**: Regulatory examination failure; can result in business shutdown
4. **Over-promising returns**: High yield products attract unqualified customers; regulatory risk
5. **Concentrated portfolio**: Too much customer money in risky assets; regulatory capital ratio hit
6. **Poor customer communication**: Lack of transparency on fees, rates, or security erodes trust
